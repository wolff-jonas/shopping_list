### What is this?

This is a simple shopping list app.  
Mainly for me to learn React, but also because I needed a better way to keep track of my shopping lists.

##### Features:

- Keep multiple, separate lists
- All your currently needed items at the top
- Unneeded items remain at the bottom, ready to be quickly re-added
- 100% client side, no server or internet connection required (after initial installation)
- Installable on the home screen of your mobile device
- Supports barcodes for point cards (currently manually entered, only EAN13 format)

### What's next?

At the moment: probably nothing. It is functional enough for my everyday use.

#### Some ideas

- Multi-Items: Group items together, useful for recipes
- Custom, drag-and-drop sorting: Challenging due to the nature of the split list
- Better barcode support: More code types and scanning via camera
- Make it look better on desktop resolutions: Maybe multiple lists side-by-side?
- A way to share lists: Maybe even keep them in sync between devices
